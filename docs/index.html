            <h3>Implicit Dependency Detection</h3>
            <p>There is no need to exhaustively list dependencies (such as C++
            header files). Dependencies for any language can be determined
            automatically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Correct Incremental Builds</h3>
            <p>Outputs removed from the build are automatically removed from
            disk. Changes are determined by file contents, not just by
            timestamps. Combined with implicit dependency detection, correct
            incremental builds can be ensured.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Recursive Builds</h3>
            <p>Any build task can also be a build system. This simple feature is
            incredibly powerful. As part of the build, you can generate your build
            description with, say, a high-level scripting language like Lua.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Automatic Builds</h3>
            <p>Dependencies can be watched to automatically trigger a build when
            they change. This can help speed up the edit-compile-test
            development cycle.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Visualize Builds</h3>
            <p>A graph of the task graph can be displayed. This helps give you
            an immediate and intuitive understanding of the structure of your
            build.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Language Independent</h3>
            <p>This is not a language-specific build system. While there are
            convenient abstractions for building common languages, there is no
            restriction to such projects. Multi-language projects can also be
            built in harmony.</p>
