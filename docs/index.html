        <h1>Button</h1>
        <p>A universal build system to build your software <em>at the push of a
            button.</em></p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Features</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Implicit Dependency Detection</h3>
            <p>There is no need to exhaustively list dependencies (such as C++
            header files). Dependencies for any language can be determined
            automatically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Correct Incremental Builds</h3>
            <p>Outputs removed from the build are automatically removed from
            disk. Changes are determined by file contents, not just by
            timestamps. Combined with implicit dependency detection, correct
            incremental builds can be ensured.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Recursive Builds</h3>
            <p>Any build task can also be a build system. This simple feature is
            incredibly powerful. As part of the build, you can generate your build
            description with, say, a high-level scripting language like Lua.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Hands-free Building</h3>
            <p>Dependencies can be watched to automatically trigger a build when
            they change. This can help speed up the edit-compile-test
            development cycle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Visualize Builds</h3>
            <p>A graph of the task graph can be displayed. This helps give you
            an immediate and intuitive understanding of the structure of your
            build.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Language Independent</h3>
            <p>This is not a language-specific build system. While there are
            convenient abstractions for building common languages, there are no
            restrictions on building projects not covered by those
            abstractions.</p>

        That sounds great, but what am I supposed to do with all these crusty,
        incomprehensible Makefiles?
        <footer>You, just now.</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 class="text-center">Automatic Conversion of Makefiles</h3>

    <p>Since the underlying build description of Button is so general,
    theoretically the build description of any other build system can be
    represented. With a modified version of GNU Make, called
    <code>button-make</code>, a Makefile can be automatically converted to the
    build description format required by Button. You get the benefit of all the
    aforementioned features while still using your beloved Makefiles. It may
    even help you find bugs in your Makefiles!</p>
