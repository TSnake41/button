# Brilliant Build

A build system that aims to be *scalable* and *correct*.

*This is a work in progress.*

## Quick Example

### Build Description

Here is a simple example of a build description:

```json
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "inputs": ["foo.c", "baz.h"],
            "task": ["gcc", "-c", "foo.c", "-o", "foo.o"],
            "outputs": ["foo.o"]
        },
        {
            "inputs": ["bar.c", "baz.h"],
            "task": ["gcc", "-c", "bar.c", "-o", "bar.o"],
            "outputs": ["bar.o"]
        },
        {
            "inputs": ["foo.o", "bar.o"],
            "task": ["gcc", "foo.o", "bar.o", "-o", "foobar"],
            "outputs": ["foobar"],
            "description": "Linking"
        }
    ]
}
```

A build description is intended to be as simple as possible such that it can be
easily generated by, say, a Python or Lua script. For now, the fundamental build
description format is JSON due to its ubiquity.

### Visualizing the Build

A visualization of the above build description can be generated using
[GraphViz][]:

```bash
$ brilliant-build visualize < basic.json | dot -Tpng > basic.png
```

### Running the Build

Suppose this is our first time running the build. In that case, we will see a
full build:

```bash
$ brilliant-build update < basic.json
 > gcc -c bar.c -o bar.o
 > gcc -c foo.c -o foo.o
 > gcc foo.o bar.o -o foobar
```

If we run it again immediately without changing any files, nothing will happen:

```bash
$ brilliant-build update < basic.json
```

Now suppose we make a change to the file `foo.c` and run the build again. Only
the necessary tasks to bring the outputs up-to-date are executed.

```bash
$ touch foo.c
$ brilliant-build update < basic.json
 > gcc -c foo.c -o foo.o
 > gcc foo.o bar.o -o foobar
```
