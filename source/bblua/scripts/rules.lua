High-level rule resolution. Client scripts add targets that may depend on each
other. Since these targets can be defined in any order, they are added to a list
and dependencies are resolved after all targets are defined.

    Converts the target's name to a usable path. This strips off anything past
    and including a ':'. This is a useful naming convention where multiple
    targets share the same base name but eventually get output to separate
    paths. For example, a shared library "libfoo.so" and a static library
    "libfoo.a" both have "foo" as the name. With this, the rules can be named
    "foo:shared" and "foo:static" to avoid a target name clash.
